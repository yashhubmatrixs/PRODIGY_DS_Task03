Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository contains documentation for Task 3 of my internship journey, focusing on data preparation, analysis, and uncovering valuable insights.

Task Overview

In Task 3, I developed a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer would purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. For this task, I used datasets like the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Skills and Knowledge Gained

This task enhanced my understanding of predictive modeling using decision tree classifiers. I gained valuable insights into how customer demographics and behaviors can influence purchasing decisions, and further strengthened my skills in applying machine learning techniques to real-world data.
